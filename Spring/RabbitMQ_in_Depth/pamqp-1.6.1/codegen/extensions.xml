            should not wait for a reply method. If the server could not
            complete the method it will raise a channel or connection exception.

        <doc>
            If set, the queue is deleted when all consumers have finished using
            it. The last consumer can be cancelled either explicitly or because
            its channel is closed. If there was no consumer ever on the queue,
            it won't be deleted. Applications can explicitly delete auto-delete
            queues using the Delete method as normal.
